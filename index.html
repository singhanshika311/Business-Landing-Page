                <p>For all the attention Apple has received this year for its new smartwatch and music service, or rumors about an updated TV device and building a car, the company is increasingly dependent on the iPhone.

                    Since the handset was introduced in 2007, the company has never collected as large a percentage of its revenue from one product as it's doing as new products and services are introduced. The device's position at the center of Apple's orbit will be on display Sept.

                <p>Xiomi is undoubtedly an amazing smartphone brand if we look at their prices. Some of their ideas are inspired by their predecessor brands like Apple and Samsung and you will get amazing stuff at affordable deals. Although, I would not recommend you to buy an MI phone now, in 2019. I feel its time to wait. If today you buy a new MI phone, tomorrow it will become outdated as they will launch another new phone with tons of new features.</p>

                <p>Samsung Smart phones are good and supremely well built. Only thing is there are bit more on the expensive side compared to their compettitors like One Plus. But yes they mostly don't compromise on any things. But now everything is price centric and they also have to get their market share, so they have started compromising somewhere to get the price of handset lower..</p>

                <p>Sony's UI is by no means bad, it's perfectly usable but lacks some of the features of other phones.
